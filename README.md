# Cyber_security_and_Anonymization_of_CT_and_MRI_data
A collection of information and code pertaining to our cybersecurity and anonymization project for CT and MRI data at GW. 

Multiple previous studies have shown that patients can be identified from automated facial recognition software (or human viewers) based on 3-D reconstructions of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This presents a security concern for public data sets published online. 

Most datasets are deidentified by removing data from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) headers without altering facial features. This makes evaluation of anonymization techniques and methods to identify weaknesses in public datasets (Such as if faces are still recognizable after brain or head and neck data is published online) to be paramount. 

We previously demonstrated that facial features (and consequently, faces) could be recognized by both a human observer and automated facial recognition software from beneath a thermoplastic simulation-CT (Sim-CT) mask used in radiation oncology. This demonstrated the ability to recognize faces not only from MRI, but also CT data in addition to the ability to recognize faces under a mask.

Our current research is focused on anonymization methods and tools to help other practitioners address this problem.
